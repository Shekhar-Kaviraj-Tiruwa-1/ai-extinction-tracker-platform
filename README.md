# AI Extinction Tracker Platform

A research-driven web platform exploring how AI-enabled industrial efficiency may accelerate biodiversity loss and ecological instability.

---

## Project Overview

AI Extinction Tracker is a single-page React application that maps a structured causal pathway:

**AI Automation → Industrial Efficiency → Animal Agriculture Expansion → Habitat Loss → Accelerated Extinction Risk → Ecosystem Imbalance**

This project does not claim that AI is the root cause of extinction. Instead, it examines how AI functions as an efficiency multiplier within economic systems that already drive land conversion, climate forcing, and biodiversity decline.

The platform aims to:

- Present credible, cited biodiversity data  
- Clarify extinction vs population decline metrics  
- Analyze AI’s role in scaling industrial throughput  
- Highlight ecosystem-level consequences  
- Provide structured action pathways grounded in evidence

## Core Components

### Extinction Data Section
Aggregated statistics from major biodiversity reports (IPBES, WWF, IUCN, FAO).

### AI & Industrial Mechanism Analysis
Examination of precision livestock farming, supply-chain optimization, and rebound effects.

### Ecosystem Impact Profiles
Case studies of vulnerable or extinct species and their ecological roles.

### Risk Framing & Governance Lens
Scenario-based analysis of how policy constraints can cap expansion effects.
